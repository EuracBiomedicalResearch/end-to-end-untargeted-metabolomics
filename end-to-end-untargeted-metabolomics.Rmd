# Introduction

# Data description

- 3 ACM, 3 CTRL, 4 (?) QC - those with largest differences on caffeine.


# Data pre-processing

## General quality assessment

- BPC and heatmaps to evaluate LC performance.
- EIC of internal standards.

## Chromatographic peak detection

## Retention time alignment

## Correspondence

## Gap filling

# Data normalization

- Evaluation on IS.

# Identification of interesting features

- Pre-filtering.
- Differential abundance.

Task: sensitivity analysis: with/without normalization. with/without
pre-filtering.


# Annotation

- Different levels of annotation.
- Just m/z (mass).
- m/z and retention time.
- MS/MS spectra + public repository.
- MS/MS spectra + retention time.
