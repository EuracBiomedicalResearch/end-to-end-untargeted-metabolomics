	abstract = {Metabolite profiling in biomarker discovery, enzyme substrate assignment, drug activity/specificity determination, and basic metabolic research requires new data preprocessing approaches to correlate specific metabolites to their biological origin. Here we introduce an LC/MS-based data analysis approach, XCMS, which incorporates novel nonlinear retention time alignment, matched filtration, peak detection, and peak matching. Without using internal standards, the method dynamically identifies hundreds of endogenous metabolites for use as standards, calculating a nonlinear retention time correction profile for each sample. Following retention time correction, the relative metabolite ion intensities are directly compared to identify changes in specific endogenous metabolites, such as potential biomarkers. The software is demonstrated using data sets from a previously reported enzyme knockout study and a large-scale study of plasma samples.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-9-504},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an important analytical technology for e.g. metabolomics experiments. Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features -- a reliable feature detection is mandatory.RESULTS:We developed a new feature detection algorithm centWave for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity.CONCLUSION:The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine. The centWave algorithm was integrated into the Bioconductor R-package XCMS and is available from (http://www.bioconductor.org/).},

	title = {Massifquant: open-source {Kalman} filter-based {XC}-{MS} isotope trace feature detection.},
	volume = {30},
	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btu359},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Isotope trace (IT) detection is a fundamental step for liquid or gas chromatography mass spectrometry (XC-MS) data analysis that faces a multitude of technical challenges on complex samples. The Kalman filter (KF) application to IT detection addresses some of these challenges; it discriminates closely eluting ITs in the m/z dimension, flexibly handles heteroscedastic m/z variances and does not bin the m/z axis. Yet, the behavior of this KF application has not been fully characterized, as no cost-free open-source implementation exists and incomplete evaluation standards for IT detection persist.RESULTS:Massifquant is an open-source solution for KF IT detection that has been subjected to novel and rigorous methods of performance evaluation. The presented evaluation with accompanying annotations and optimization guide sets a new standard for comparative IT detection. Compared with centWave, matchedFilter and MZMine2-alternative IT detection engines-Massifquant detected more true ITs in a real LC-MS complex sample, especially low-intensity ITs. It also offers competitive specificity and equally effective quantitation accuracy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:Massifquant is integrated into XCMS with GPL license ≥ 2.0 and hosted by Bioconductor: http://bioconductor.org.
