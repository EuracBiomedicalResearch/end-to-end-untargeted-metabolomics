Streamlining LC-MS/MS Data Analysis with Open-Source *xcms* and 
*RforMassSpectrometry*: An End-to-End Workflow

Metabolomics provides a real-time view of the metabolic state of examined
samples, with mass spectrometry serving as a key tool in deciphering intricate 
differences in metabolomes due to specific factors. In the context of 
metabolomic investigations, untargeted LC-MS/MS emerges as a powerful approach.
This poster/presentation focuses on the analysis of an example dataset aimed at
identifying variations in plasma metabolite levels between patients with 
Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and healthy controls. From the
preprocessing of raw mzML files up to annotation of differentially abundant
ions between the two groups. 

Despite the potential insights offered by untargeted LC-MS/MS data, a 
significant challenge in the field lies in the absence of a reproducible and
scalable infrastructure for its analysis. While various specialized packages
exist for specific analysis steps, seamless integration and adaptability to
large cohort dataset remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we present an
comprehensible R workflow that leverages xcms and packages of the
RforMassSpectrometry environment to encompass all aspects of pre-processing
and downstream analyses for LC-MS/MS datasets in a reproducible manner. Our 
workflow seamlessly integrates Bioconductor packages, offering adaptability
to diverse study designs and analysis requirements. This workflow facilitates 
preprocessing, feature detection, alignment, normalization, statistical
analysis and annotation within a unified framework, enhancing the efficiency of
metabolomic investigations. We also discuss alternative ways to adapt to any
dataset and goals as well as promoting proper quality management for LC-MS
analysis.
