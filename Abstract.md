Title proposal: 

End-to-end workflow for LC-MS/MS pre-processing and analysis using 
open-source *xcms* software and the *RforMassSpectrometry* environment.

Streamlining LC-MS/MS Data Analysis with Open-Source *xcms* and 
*RforMassSpectrometry*: An End-to-End Workflow


Despite untargeted LC-MS/MS data being a powerful approach in investigating 
metabolomics, a significant challenge in the field lies in the absence of a 
reproducible, scalable and stable infrastructure for its analysis. While various 
specialized packages exist for specific analysis steps, seamless integration 
and adaptability to large cohort dataset remains elusive. Addressing this gap, 
we present an comprehensible end-to-end R workflow that leverages xcms and 
packages of the RforMassSpectrometry environment to encompass all aspects of 
pre-processing and downstream analyses for LC-MS/MS datasets in a reproducible
manner.

This poster/presentation delineates a step-by-step analysis of an example 
dataset focused on discerning variations in plasma metabolite levels between 
patients with a cardiovascular disease and healthy controls. The objective is 
to meticulously detail each step, from the preprocessing of raw mzML files to
the annotation of differentially abundant ions between the two groups.

Our  workflow seamlessly integrates Bioconductor packages, offering adaptability
to diverse study designs and analysis requirements. This workflow facilitates 
preprocessing, feature detection, alignment, normalization, statistical
analysis and annotation within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the 
efficiency of metabolomic investigations. We also discuss alternative 
approaches to accommodate various dataset and goals, while emphasizing proper
quality management for LC-MS analysis.
